1. We compare the addresses of two objects in order to avoid memory deletion, which contains resource data.  
For example, if we do not include check action and object A has the same address as object B, then when the assignment operator is called, the delete operator 
will release all resource data of the object and we will lose access to the source resource, which will lead to errors in the program.

2.Contact::Contact(const Contact& cont) {
		
   m_phone = nullptr;
		
  *this = cont;
	} call an assignment operator to avoid repeating logic

   
*this = Contact(); to set the current object to the safe empty state instead of initializing each of the instances again


3.I have learned how dynamic memory works and how the process of releasing its memory occurs. 
  Also, I have learned about the extension process of dynamic memory for the purpose of adding a new data.
